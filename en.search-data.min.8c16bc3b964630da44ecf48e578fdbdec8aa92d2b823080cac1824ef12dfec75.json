This extension doesn\u0026rsquo;t replace Input Remapper (or its UI), it just makes it easier to use.\nAll of these functions are available directly from a button in the GNOME top panel.\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/gnome-input-remapper/docs/installation/","title":"Installation","section":"Docs","content":" Installation # Installing Input Remapper for GNOME # The extension isn\u0026rsquo;t available on the GNOME Extensions site yet, so we\u0026rsquo;ll cover the steps to manually install it.\nGetting this extension set up and ready shouldn\u0026rsquo;t take more than a few minutes! Follow the steps below:\n1. Make sure Input Remapper is ready # Once you\u0026rsquo;ve installed Input Remapper, launch the UI to make sure it runs and detects your peripherals\n2. Configure your presets # The plugin just lets you control your presets, so you\u0026rsquo;ll still need to set them up. While you can create them manually, your best bet is to use the Input Remapper desktop app (input-remapper-gtk) like usual. You can create as many presets for as many devices as you want.\n3. Install the extension # Install from File # Download the gnome-input-remapper.zip file from the latest release on GitHub. Open a terminal, change to the directory containing the downloaded ZIP file Run gnome-extensions install gnome-input-remapper.zip Log out and log back in, or restart your PC 4. Enable the extension # If the extension isn\u0026rsquo;t already enabled when you log back in, open the GNOME Extensions app and enable it.\nYou can also run gnome-extensions enable gnome-input-remapper@agc93.dev from a terminal.\n5. Open the new menu # You should have a new menu in the top bar with a keyboard icon! Click the icon to open the new menu.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s more information on using the extension here.\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/gnome-input-remapper/docs/usage/","title":"Usage","section":"Docs","content":" Using Input Remapper for GNOME # Once you\u0026rsquo;ve installed and enabled the extension, you\u0026rsquo;ll have a new button in your GNOME top panel, with a keyboard icon.\nClick the icon to open the menu. The menu will list any devices with configured presets, and if you click any device it will list all presets for that device. Click the preset name and the extension will tell Input Remapper to start injecting keystrokes for the device according to the preset.\nDue to how Input Remapper works for now, there might be a couple of seconds delay between clicking the menu entry and the preset being applied.\nThe icon beside each device in the menu indicates if a preset is currently running or not:\n❔: Unknown state, this generally means Input Remapper hasn\u0026rsquo;t been started for the device ⏹️: Stopped. Input Remapper is not currently mapping the device. ▶️: Running. Input Remapper is injecting keystrokes for this device. If there is a preset running for the device, you\u0026rsquo;ll see an extra Stop menu item that will stop injecting keystrokes for that device. You can also click the ⏹️ button at the top of the menu to stop injecting keystrokes for all devices at once.\nConfiguration # While the extension will work out-of-the-box for most users, there are a couple of extra options you may want/need to change:\nOpening extension preferences # You can open the extension settings by finding Input Remapper Control in the GNOME Extensions app, click the three dots and click Settings.\nOptions # Configuration Directory Path # If you have multiple Input Remapper installs, or you use a custom configuration directory, you can set the path to use here.\nThe extension will use this directory to list presets, and will automatically configure Input Remapper to use this directory when starting and stopping device presets.\nPreset Actions (Interface) # This option is for advanced users who want to manually edit your device presets. If you enable this option, the menu will add quick actions to each preset to quickly open the preset file itself with the default application.\nEnable Notifications (Interface) # By default, the extension will send notifications whenever presets are started or stopped from the menu. If you\u0026rsquo;d prefer not to get these, just toggle this option to disable them entirely.\n"},{"id":3,"href":"/gnome-input-remapper/docs/faq/","title":"FAQ","section":"Docs","content":" Frequently Asked Questions # Why aren\u0026rsquo;t all of my devices listed in the menu? # The plugin will only list devices that have at least one preset configured. Open Input Remapper and add a preset for your chosen device and when you next open the Input Remapper menu in GNOME, it will be listed.\nCan I safely remove the extension? # Absolutely. From the GNOME Extensions app, find Input Remapper Control in the list, click the three dots icon, click Remove\u0026hellip; and the extension will be removed. This will not affect your Input Remapper install or any of your devices and presets.\n"}]
