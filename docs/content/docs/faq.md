# Frequently Asked Questions

## Why aren't all of my devices listed in the menu?

The plugin will only list devices that have at least one preset configured. Open Input Remapper and add a preset for your chosen device and when you next open the Input Remapper menu in GNOME, it will be listed.

## Can I safely remove the extension?

Absolutely. From the GNOME Extensions app, find Input Remapper Control in the list, click the three dots icon, click *Remove...* and the extension will be removed. This will not affect your Input Remapper install or any of your devices and presets.
