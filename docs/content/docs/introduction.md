## About Input Remapper for GNOME

This extension for GNOME Shell allows you to control [Input Remapper](https://github.com/sezanzeb/input-remapper) from your GNOME desktop. With this extension installed, you can:

- See which devices Input Remapper is currently injecting keystrokes for
- Quickly activate any of your configured presets
- Stop injecting for any specific device, or all devices at once
- Quickly open Input Remapper itself, or any of its configuration files

{{% hint warning %}}
You'll need Input Remapper installed and running for this extension to work correctly! This extension doesn't replace Input Remapper (or its UI), it just makes it easier to use.

All of these functions are available directly from a button in the GNOME top panel.
